## Task 3

Create a **Product** class with fields **name** of type **String** and **price** of type **double**.

The **Product** class must meet the following principles:

1. All class fields must be **private**.
2. Get and set methods must be used to access the class fields.
3. The class must have a constructors with and without parameters.

In the **Product** class write **count() static** method that returns ***count of created objects*** of **Product** type.

For example, next fragment of code:

Will be print to console:
```
Was created 3 new products!
```

> For correct passing of all tests don't use print and println methods in your code.
